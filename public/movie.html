    <h1>The Greatest Christmas Films of All Time</h1>
    <h2>My top Christmas films of all time</h2>
    <p>Merry Christmas!<br />
         It is time to put up the Christmas decorations, eat mince pies, and drink Bailey’s. Most importantly, it is time once again to watch <b>Christmas films</b>.<br />
        Each year, I carefully analyse Christmas films and break them down into categories for your convenience.
        </p>
        
        <p>But first, let me define what a Christmas film is: "A Christmas film is a cinematic work that centres its narrative, themes, or setting around Christmas. These films typically explore elements such as festive traditions, goodwill, family, leaping off skyscrapers with a hose tied around your waist, and the magic of Christmas." </p>
    
    <p>In true High-Fidelity style, I have provided the top 5 Christmas films in a variety of categories. Get ready for a sleigh ride through the classics, the hilariously bad, the new gems, the soppy, and some bizarre ones. The lists are:
        <ul>
        <li>Essentials: The tried and true, it is not Christmas until you watch all of these.</li> 
        <li>So Bad They're Good: Because let's face it, corny is what we want from a Christmas film.</li>
        <li>Animated films: Because everyone loves cartoons.</li>
       <li>Soppy Christmas: Some people like these.</li>
       <li>Alternative Christmas List: For those who like a little horror or a sprinkle of the unexpected with their Bailey’s.</li> 
        <li>New Films (Since 2021): Freshly unwrapped presents for your viewing pleasure.</li>
        </ul>    
    </p>
    
    <p>So, I will provide a list of 30 Christmas films to get you into the spirit! This is my gift to you all!<br />
        Feel free to debate, discuss, and, most importantly, enjoy these festive flicks. May your Christmas be filled with laughter, joy, and hopefully, no arguments about whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie. <u>Because it is</u>. Get over it.
